# Brief Intro:

#### Being born and raised in Silicon Valley, I've always been around the Tech Industry. After a career change from Audio Engineering, I finally decided to take a step into this ever-evolving landscape by beginning a new journey through Data Engineering. The following projects showcase some of the latest technologies used to build Data Engineering ETL Pipelines. 

## Team Week 3
This project was a group collabrative project with two other of my classmates. We each took datasets reloving around money, stock prices, and natural disasters and developed ETL pipelines using Python's Pandas library that was then automated using Airflow. I specifically developed the ETL pipeline that dealt with Tornado natural disasters and created visualizations with my analysies.
